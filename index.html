        <h2><span class="icon">⭐</span>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This project is a detailed study of the Banking System of India, created to help understand the basic concepts of financial literacy. It explains the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the difference between public and private sector banks, and the functions of an ATM. The project also provides simple definitions of debit cards, credit cards, and the major companies that issue these cards.</p>
        <p>In addition, it includes short overviews of important Indian banks such as SBI, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank, highlighting their features and services. The project also introduces the concept of a micro ATM, which brings banking services to rural and remote areas.</p>
        <p>Overall, this project aims to give students a clear understanding of how banks work, how digital banking tools are used, and why financial awareness is important in daily life.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏛️</span>Banking System Overview</h2>
        <p>Banks are broadly categorized by ownership (Public/Govt., Private, Foreign), function (Retail for individuals, Commercial for businesses, Investment for capital markets, Central as regulator), and target (Cooperative, Regional Rural, Small Finance, Payment Banks for inclusion). They provide services like deposits (Savings, Current), loans, digital platforms, and specialized financial products, all under the umbrella of national financial regulations, with the Central Bank (RBI in India) acting as the apex body.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="atm">
        <h2><span class="icon">💳</span>ATM (Automated Teller Machine)</h2>
        <p>ATMs are self-service banking terminals that let customers withdraw cash, check balance, and perform basic transactions without visiting a branch. They are categorized by location (on-site, off-site, mobile) and function (withdrawal, deposit, inquiry, PIN services). ATMs connect to the bank’s central network for real-time verification and work with card networks like Visa, Mastercard, and RuPay. By offering 24×7 access, ATMs reduce branch traffic and make banking more convenient and accessible, especially in rural and semi-urban areas.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="debit">
        <h2><span class="icon">💳</span>Debit Card</h2>
        <p>Debit cards are bank-issued payment cards linked directly to a customer’s savings or current account. They allow cash withdrawal, online/offline purchases, and balance inquiries, with every transaction deducted instantly from the user’s account. Debit cards operate on networks like Visa, Mastercard, and RuPay, ensuring nationwide and international usability. As real-time, account-based instruments, they promote secure cashless payments and easy access to funds.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="credit">
        <h2><span class="icon">💳</span>Credit Card</h2>
        <p>Credit cards are bank-issued payment instruments that let customers borrow money up to a preset limit for purchases and bill payments. The amount is repaid later within a monthly billing cycle, often with benefits like rewards, EMI options, and cashback. They run on networks such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, enabling global transactions. By offering short-term credit and flexible payment features, credit cards support convenience, financial planning, and controlled borrowing.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="micro-atm">
        <h2><span class="icon">📱</span>Micro ATM</h2>
        <p>Micro ATMs are portable, handheld banking devices operated by banking correspondents to provide basic financial services in rural and remote areas. They support cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and account verification using Aadhaar authentication, PIN, or debit card. Connected to the bank’s central system, they enable real-time transactions even where branches or full ATMs are unavailable. By extending essential banking access to underserved regions, micro ATMs promote financial inclusion and doorstep banking.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">✅</span>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project highlights how India’s banking system works together to support individuals, businesses, and the overall economy.
